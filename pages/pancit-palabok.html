        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the rice noodles in water for about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the sauce by heating a saucepan. Pour-in the cooking oil.</li>
            <li>When the oil is hot enough, put-in the ground pork and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes</li>
            <li>Dilute the annato powder in pork broth then pour the mixture in the saucepan. Bring to a boil (If you are using anatto seeds, soak them first in 3 tbsp water to bring-out the color)</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp cube and stir and simmer for 3 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the flour gradually while stirring.</li>
            <li>Add the fish sauce and ground black pepper then simmer until sauce becomes thick. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Boil enough water in a pot.</li>
            <li>Place the soaked noodles in a metal/bamboo strainer then submerge the strainer in the boiling water for about a minute or until the noodles are cooked. They should still be firm.</li>
            <li>Remove the strainer from the pot and drain the liquid from the noodles.</li>
            <li>Place the noodles in the serving plate.</li>
            <li>Pour the sauce on top of the noodles then arrange the toppings over the sauce.</li>
